Root, the Superuser
root - access typically restricted to system administrators
~ 'tilda', represents the home directory

pwd: display Present Working Directory
man: manual pages
echo: displays file contents
exit: exit session
clear: clear screen

echo $PATH: display PATH string

Summary Lecture 20: How to Fish
man - used to display documentation
$PATH controls search path...
	echo $PATH displays the search directories whenever we enter a command at prompt
which : use this command to find the path to a command
	i.e. which cat, which pwd, etc...
--help or -h: help command
-k : man -k [search term] , search the man pages

git config --global credential.helper wincred : sets up GitHub password in Git
** this is for Windows system

For Linux:
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
	** change time in seconds, 3600 = 1 hours.

** test test; see if caching works... test test**

. 'this directory'
.. 'parent directory'
$ pwd
/home/jason
$ cd ..
/home

./command
echo $PATH

mkdir - creates new directory
rmdir - removes directory (only if empty)
rm -rf directory - if there are contents inside the directory. this is hard erase
examples:
mkdir dir1
mkdir dir1/dir2/dir3
this won't create because no parents
instead, do this...
mkdir -p dir/1/dir2/dir3 # -p is parent...create parents

Lecture 24: Listing Files and Understanding is Output
what is 'ls -l'?
-l is long format
ie. -rw-rw-r-- 1 jason users 10400 Sept27...

hidden files begin with .
use ls -a to output 'all' files

ls -t # sort by time
ls -r $ sort by reverse
ls -latr # sort long listing, all files, time

ls -R # all contents in the directory and below

tree -d : list directories only

naming directories:
camelCase
_underscore
use-hyphen

Decoder ring for permissions, ie via ls -l
-rw-r--r--
- : Type
rw- : User
r-- : Group
r-- : Other

Changing Permissions:
chmod - change mode
rwx - read, write, execute
ugoa - u for user, g for group, o for other, a for all
+-= - + to add permission, - to subtract, = explicitely set
Example: add write permission for the members of a file's group, you would say:
chmod g+w filename (g(group)+(add) w(write permission))
ie. chmod g+w sales.data

numeric based permission: ie chmod 754 filename (see table to get listing)

chgrp - change group 

chmod 777 give user,group, other full permission to read,write,execute

Lecture 28: Finding Files
find [path...] [expression]

find . -name pattern # finds files whose name matches pattern
find . -iname pattern # same as name but ignores case

locate pattern # a more rapid search method

head -2 [filename] displays the first two lines in the file
tail -3 [filename] displays the bottom last three lines in the file

to follow files in real-time:
tail -f filename

Lecture 33: Editing Files with Vi

vi [filename] - enters edit mode of filename


Lecture 39: Delete, Copying, Moving, Renaming Files

rm file
rm -r dir
rm -f file : force removal without confirmation
rm s*

cp source_file destination_file
cp -i : interactive mode
cp -r source_directory destination (r recursively)

mv can be used to move directory or rename

sort file
sort -k F sort by key

tar/gzip/gunzip/zcat etc...

du estimates file usage

Wildcards (Lesson 40):
* matches zero or more characters
? matches exactly one character (a?.txt)

Lecture 42: Input, Output, Redirection
stdin
stdout
stderr

Comparing Files
diff
sdiff
vimdiff

grep : search for text in a file
grep pattern file : find pattern in file

grep -v pattern file, invert match, return lines that do not match pattern

grep -i ignore case

Pipes:

| pipe symbol

command output | command input
cat file | grep pattern
output from cat gets passed to grep

Lecture 47: Transferring Files over the Network
ftp host
	not encrypted
use sftp for s-secure
